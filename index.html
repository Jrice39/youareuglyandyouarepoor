            <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
            <p>Why does anything exist? Usually to get one over on someone, or out of spite. But this less about that and more about
                learning full-stack development by going back to web school kindergarten. This site is proof that understanding the fundamentals pays off (thumbs up emoji). What will it become? TBD. For now, it's a playground and a statement: I built this, not you. You had nothing to do with this. Go kick rocks.</p>
