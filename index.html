            <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
            <p>Good question. But why does anything exist? I could get into this with you and waste both of our precious moments figuring out the answer, but the bottom line is this is about 
                learning full-stack development by going back to first principles. This site is proof that understanding the fundamentals pays off. What will it become? TBD. For now, it's a playground and a statement: I built this, not you. You had nothing to do with this. Go kick rocks.</p>
